My Weather App

This app is a simple weather app I am in the process of building. The core functionality is working properly. I am still working on the settings page, which will allow users to customize the way they interact with the app and how much information is displayed to them. I am also working on implementing a swipe view, allowing users to swipe between different locations. This will provide a much better user experience because they will be able to save their five favorite locations and easily switch between them.
